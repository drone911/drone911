### Hi there 👋
This is Jigar Patel (He/Him 👦)
- 🐊 I am a CS Master's student at the University of Florida with a focus on Software Development and Cybersecurity. Currently holding a 3.94 GPA.
- 🚅 AWS Solutions Architect Associate with ample exposure to Angular, React, and Node.js.
- I am currently developing two comprehensive web applications to further hone my skills, covering the entire development cycle from initial concept to final deployment.  
      (1) [**CatchMeIfYouScan**](https://github.com/drone911/CatchMeIfYouScan) {React, Nodejs, Jest, Terraform}: A web tool that let's penetration testers identify what code signatures are being caught by antivirus's.  
      (2) [**TransFormPix**](https://github.com/drone911/TransFormPix) {React, Terraform}: A side-project that I wanted to implement that let's you apply Affine Transforms (Rotate, Scale, Shear, and Tranlate) images.
